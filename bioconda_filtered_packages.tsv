r-pathfindr	Enrichment analysis enables researchers to uncover mechanisms underlying a phenotype. However, conventional methods for enrichment analysis do not take into account protein-protein interaction information, resulting in incomplete conclusions. pathfindR is a tool for enrichment analysis utilizing active subnetworks. The main function identifies active subnetworks in a protein-protein interaction network using a user-provided list of genes and associated p values. It then performs enrichment analyses on the identified subnetworks, identifying enriched terms (i.e. pathways or, more broadly, gene sets) that possibly underlie the phenotype of interest. pathfindR also offers functionalities to cluster the enriched terms and identify representative terms in each cluster, to score the enriched terms per sample and to visualize analysis results. The enrichment, clustering and other methods implemented in pathfindR are described in detail in Ulgen E, Ozisik O, Sezerman OU. 2019. pathfindR: An R Package for Comprehensive Identification of Enriched Pathways in Omics Data Through Active Subnetworks.

ChExMix uses a mixture modeling framework to probabilistically model the genomic locations and subtype membership of protein-DNA binding events, leveraging both ChIP-exo tag enrichment patterns and DNA sequence information. In doing so, ChExMix offers a more principled and robust approach to characterizing binding subtypes than simply clustering binding events using motif information.	2023-06-16

r-mvr	This is a non-parametric method for joint adaptive mean-variance regularization and variance stabilization of high-dimensional data. It is suited for handling difficult problems posed by high-dimensional multivariate datasets (p >> n paradigm). Among those are that the variance is often a function of the mean, variable-specific estimators of variances are not reliable, and tests statistics have low powers due to a lack of degrees of freedom. Key features include: (i) Normalization and/or variance stabilization of the data, (ii) Computation of mean-variance-regularized t-statistics (F-statistics to follow), (iii) Generation of diverse diagnostic plots, (iv) Computationally efficient implementation using C/C++ interfacing and an option for parallel computing to enjoy a faster and easier experience in the R environment.	2023-06-16

biopet-extractadaptersfastqc	ExtractAdaptersFastqc reads which adapter sequences where found from a FastQC raw report.	2023-06-16
r-treesim	Simulation methods for phylogenetic trees where (i) all tips are sampled at one time point or (ii) tips are sampled sequentially through time. (i) For sampling at one time point, simulations are performed under a constant rate birth-death process, conditioned on having a fixed number of final tips (sim.bd.taxa()), or a fixed age (sim.bd.age()), or a fixed age and number of tips (sim.bd.taxa.age()). When conditioning on the number of final tips, the method allows for shifts in rates and mass extinction events during the birth-death process (sim.rateshift.taxa()). The function sim.bd.age() (and sim.rateshift.taxa() without extinction) allow the speciation rate to change in a density-dependent way. The LTT plots of the simulations can be displayed using LTT.plot(), LTT.plot.gen() and LTT.average.root(). TreeSim further samples trees with n final tips from a set of trees generated by the common sampling algorithm stopping when a fixed number m>>n of tips is first reached (sim.gsa.taxa()). This latter method is appropriate for m-tip trees generated under a big class of models (details in the sim.gsa.taxa() man page). For incomplete phylogeny, the missing speciation events can be added through simulations (corsim()). (ii) sim.rateshifts.taxa() is generalized to sim.bdsky.stt() for serially sampled trees, where the trees are conditioned on either the number of sampled tips or the age. Furthermore, for a multitype-branching process with sequential sampling, trees on a fixed number of tips can be simulated using sim.bdtypes.stt.taxa(). This function further allows to simulate under epidemiological models with an exposed class. The function sim.genespeciestree() simulates coalescent gene trees within birth-death species trees, and sim.genetree() simulates coalescent gene trees.	2023-06-16

r-mixomics	Multivariate methods are well suited to large omics data sets where the number of variables (e.g. genes, proteins, metabolites) is much larger than the number of samples (patients, cells, mice). They have the appealing properties of reducing the dimension of the data by using instrumental variables (components), which are defined as combinations of all variables. Those components are then used to produce useful graphical outputs that enable better understanding of the relationships and correlation structures between the different data sets that are integrated. mixOmics offers a wide range of multivariate methods for the exploration and integration of biological datasets with a particular focus on variable selection. The package proposes several sparse multivariate models we have developed to identify the key variables that are highly correlated, and/or explain the biological outcome of interest. The data that can be analysed with mixOmics may come from high throughput sequencing technologies, such as omics data (transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, metagenomics etc) but also beyond the realm of omics (e.g. spectral imaging). The methods implemented in mixOmics can also handle missing values without having to delete entire rows with missing data. A non exhaustive list of methods include variants of generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis, sparse Partial Least Squares and sparse Discriminant Analysis. Recently we implemented integrative methods to combine multiple data sets: N-integration with variants of Generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis and P-integration with variants of multi-group Partial Least Squares.	2023-06-16

r-bit	bitmapped vectors of booleans (no NAs),  coercion from and to logicals, integers and integer subscripts;  fast boolean operators and fast summary statistics.  With 'bit' vectors you can store true binary booleans {FALSE,TRUE} at the  expense of 1 bit only, on a 32 bit architecture this means factor 32 less  RAM and ~ factor 32 more speed on boolean operations. Due to overhead of  R calls, actual speed gain depends on the size of the vector: expect gains  for vectors of size > 10000 elements. Even for one-time boolean operations  it can pay-off to convert to bit, the pay-off is obvious, when such  components are used more than once.  Reading from and writing to bit is approximately as fast as accessing  standard logicals - mostly due to R's time for memory allocation. The package  allows to work with pre-allocated memory for return values by calling .Call()  directly: when evaluating the speed of C-access with pre-allocated vector  memory, coping from bit to logical requires only 70% of the time for copying  from logical to logical; and copying from logical to bit comes at a  performance penalty of 150%. the package now contains further classes for  representing logical selections: 'bitwhich' for very skewed selections and  'ri' for selecting ranges of values for chunked processing. All three index  classes can be used for subsetting 'ff' objects (ff-2.1-0 and higher).	2023-06-16

r-dunn.test	Computes Dunn's test (1964) for stochastic dominance and reports the results among multiple pairwise comparisons after a Kruskal-Wallis test for stochastic dominance among k groups (Kruskal and Wallis, 1952). The interpretation of stochastic dominance requires an assumption that the CDF of one group does not cross the CDF of the other. 'dunn.test' makes k(k-1)/2 multiple pairwise comparisons based on Dunn's z-test-statistic approximations to the actual rank statistics. The null hypothesis for each pairwise comparison is that the probability of observing a randomly selected value from the first group that is larger than a randomly selected value from the second group equals one half; this null hypothesis corresponds to that of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank-sum test. Like the rank-sum test, if the data can be assumed to be continuous, and the distributions are assumed identical except for a difference in location, Dunn's test may be understood as a test for median difference. 'dunn.test' accounts for tied ranks.	2023-06-16

r-fda	These functions were developed to support functional data analysis as described in Ramsay, J. O. and Silverman, B. W. (2005) Functional Data Analysis. New York: Springer.  They were ported from earlier versions in Matlab and S-PLUS.  An introduction appears in Ramsay, J. O., Hooker, Giles, and Graves, Spencer (2009) Functional Data Analysis with R and Matlab (Springer). The package includes data sets and script files working many examples including all but one of the 76 figures in this latter book.  Matlab versions of the code and sample analyses are no longer distributed through CRAN, as they were when the book was published.  For those, ftp from http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/FDAfuns/ There you find a set of .zip files containing the functions and sample analyses, as well as two .txt files giving instructions for installation and some additional information. The changes from Version 2.4.1 are fixes of bugs in density.fd and removal of functions create.polynomial.basis, polynompen, and  polynomial. These were deleted because the monomial basis does the same thing and because there were errors in the code.	2023-06-16
toposort	A topological sort algorithm for Python.	2023-06-16
r-catools	Contains several basic utility functions including: moving (rolling, running) window statistic functions, read/write for GIF and ENVI binary files, fast calculation of AUC, LogitBoost classifier, base64 encoder/decoder, round-off-error-free sum and cumsum, etc.	2023-06-16

r-fda	These functions were developed to support functional data analysis as described in Ramsay, J. O. and Silverman, B. W. (2005) Functional Data Analysis. New York: Springer.  They were ported from earlier versions in Matlab and S-PLUS.  An introduction appears in Ramsay, J. O., Hooker, Giles, and Graves, Spencer (2009) Functional Data Analysis with R and Matlab (Springer). The package includes data sets and script files working many examples including all but one of the 76 figures in this latter book.  Matlab versions of the code and sample analyses are no longer distributed through CRAN, as they were when the book was published.  For those, ftp from http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/FDAfuns/ There you find a set of .zip files containing the functions and sample analyses, as well as two .txt files giving instructions for installation and some additional information. The changes from Version 2.4.1 are fixes of bugs in density.fd and removal of functions create.polynomial.basis, polynompen, and  polynomial. These were deleted because the monomial basis does the same thing and because there were errors in the code.	2023-06-16

r-fda	These functions were developed to support functional data analysis as described in Ramsay, J. O. and Silverman, B. W. (2005) Functional Data Analysis. New York: Springer.  They were ported from earlier versions in Matlab and S-PLUS.  An introduction appears in Ramsay, J. O., Hooker, Giles, and Graves, Spencer (2009) Functional Data Analysis with R and Matlab (Springer). The package includes data sets and script files working many examples including all but one of the 76 figures in this latter book.  Matlab versions of the code and sample analyses are no longer distributed through CRAN, as they were when the book was published.  For those, ftp from http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/FDAfuns/ There you find a set of .zip files containing the functions and sample analyses, as well as two .txt files giving instructions for installation and some additional information. The changes from Version 2.4.1 are fixes of bugs in density.fd and removal of functions create.polynomial.basis, polynompen, and  polynomial. These were deleted because the monomial basis does the same thing and because there were errors in the code.	2023-06-16

r-fda	These functions were developed to support functional data analysis as described in Ramsay, J. O. and Silverman, B. W. (2005) Functional Data Analysis. New York: Springer.  They were ported from earlier versions in Matlab and S-PLUS.  An introduction appears in Ramsay, J. O., Hooker, Giles, and Graves, Spencer (2009) Functional Data Analysis with R and Matlab (Springer). The package includes data sets and script files working many examples including all but one of the 76 figures in this latter book.  Matlab versions of the code and sample analyses are no longer distributed through CRAN, as they were when the book was published.  For those, ftp from http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/FDAfuns/ There you find a set of .zip files containing the functions and sample analyses, as well as two .txt files giving instructions for installation and some additional information. The changes from Version 2.4.1 are fixes of bugs in density.fd and removal of functions create.polynomial.basis, polynompen, and  polynomial. These were deleted because the monomial basis does the same thing and because there were errors in the code.	2023-06-16

Matlab versions of the code and sample analyses are no longer distributed through CRAN, as they were when the book was published.  For those, ftp from http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/FDAfuns/ There you find a set of .zip files containing the functions and sample analyses, as well as two .txt files giving instructions for installation and some additional information. The changes from Version 2.4.1 are fixes of bugs in density.fd and removal of functions create.polynomial.basis, polynompen, and  polynomial. These were deleted because the monomial basis does the same thing and because there were errors in the code.	2023-06-16

r-fda	These functions were developed to support functional data analysis as described in Ramsay, J. O. and Silverman, B. W. (2005) Functional Data Analysis. New York: Springer.  They were ported from earlier versions in Matlab and S-PLUS.  An introduction appears in Ramsay, J. O., Hooker, Giles, and Graves, Spencer (2009) Functional Data Analysis with R and Matlab (Springer). The package includes data sets and script files working many examples including all but one of the 76 figures in this latter book.  Matlab versions of the code and sample analyses are no longer distributed through CRAN, as they were when the book was published.  For those, ftp from http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/FDAfuns/ There you find a set of .zip files containing the functions and sample analyses, as well as two .txt files giving instructions for installation and some additional information. The changes from Version 2.4.1 are fixes of bugs in density.fd and removal of functions create.polynomial.basis, polynompen, and  polynomial. These were deleted because the monomial basis does the same thing and because there were errors in the code.	2023-06-16
toposort	A topological sort algorithm for Python.	2023-06-16
r-catools	Contains several basic utility functions including: moving (rolling, running) window statistic functions, read/write for GIF and ENVI binary files, fast calculation of AUC, LogitBoost classifier, base64 encoder/decoder, round-off-error-free sum and cumsum, etc.	2023-06-16

r-fda	These functions were developed to support functional data analysis as described in Ramsay, J. O. and Silverman, B. W. (2005) Functional Data Analysis. New York: Springer.  They were ported from earlier versions in Matlab and S-PLUS.  An introduction appears in Ramsay, J. O., Hooker, Giles, and Graves, Spencer (2009) Functional Data Analysis with R and Matlab (Springer). The package includes data sets and script files working many examples including all but one of the 76 figures in this latter book.  Matlab versions of the code and sample analyses are no longer distributed through CRAN, as they were when the book was published.  For those, ftp from http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/FDAfuns/ There you find a set of .zip files containing the functions and sample analyses, as well as two .txt files giving instructions for installation and some additional information. The changes from Version 2.4.1 are fixes of bugs in density.fd and removal of functions create.polynomial.basis, polynompen, and  polynomial. These were deleted because the monomial basis does the same thing and because there were errors in the code.	2023-06-16

O., Hooker, Giles, and Graves, Spencer (2009) Functional Data Analysis with R and Matlab (Springer). The package includes data sets and script files working many examples including all but one of the 76 figures in this latter book.  Matlab versions of the code and sample analyses are no longer distributed through CRAN, as they were when the book was published.  For those, ftp from http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/FDAfuns/ There you find a set of .zip files containing the functions and sample analyses, as well as two .txt files giving instructions for installation and some additional information. The changes from Version 2.4.1 are fixes of bugs in density.fd and removal of functions create.polynomial.basis, polynompen, and  polynomial. These were deleted because the monomial basis does the same thing and because there were errors in the code.	2023-06-16
toposort	A topological sort algorithm for Python.	2023-06-16
r-catools	Contains several basic utility functions including: moving (rolling, running) window statistic functions, read/write for GIF and ENVI binary files, fast calculation of AUC, LogitBoost classifier, base64 encoder/decoder, round-off-error-free sum and cumsum, etc.	2023-06-16
