r-pathfindr	Enrichment analysis enables researchers to uncover mechanisms underlying a phenotype. However conventional methods for enrichment analysis do not take into account protein-protein interaction information resulting in incomplete conclusions. pathfindR is a tool for enrichment analysis utilizing active subnetworks. The main function identifies active subnetworks in a protein-protein interaction network using a user-provided list of genes and associated p values. It then performs enrichment analyses on the identified subnetworks identifying enriched terms (i.e. pathways or more broadly gene sets) that possibly underlie the phenotype of interest. pathfindR also offers functionalities to cluster the enriched terms and identify representative terms in each cluster to score the enriched terms per sample and to visualize analysis results. The enrichment clustering and other methods implemented in pathfindR are described in detail in Ulgen E Ozisik O Sezerman OU. 2019. pathfindR: An R Package for Comprehensive Identification of Enriched Pathways in Omics Data Through Active Subnetworks.

r-treesim	Simulation methods for phylogenetic trees where (i) all tips are sampled at one time point or (ii) tips are sampled sequentially through time. (i) For sampling at one time point simulations are performed under a constant rate birth-death process conditioned on having a fixed number of final tips (sim.bd.taxa()) or a fixed age (sim.bd.age()) or a fixed age and number of tips (sim.bd.taxa.age()). When conditioning on the number of final tips the method allows for shifts in rates and mass extinction events during the birth-death process (sim.rateshift.taxa()). The function sim.bd.age() (and sim.rateshift.taxa() without extinction) allow the speciation rate to change in a density-dependent way. The LTT plots of the simulations can be displayed using LTT.plot() LTT.plot.gen() and LTT.average.root(). TreeSim further samples trees with n final tips from a set of trees generated by the common sampling algorithm stopping when a fixed number m>>n of tips is first reached (sim.gsa.taxa()). This latter method is appropriate for m-tip trees generated under a big class of models (details in the sim.gsa.taxa() man page). For incomplete phylogeny the missing speciation events can be added through simulations (corsim()). (ii) sim.rateshifts.taxa() is generalized to sim.bdsky.stt() for serially sampled trees where the trees are conditioned on either the number of sampled tips or the age. Furthermore for a multitype-branching process with sequential sampling trees on a fixed number of tips can be simulated using sim.bdtypes.stt.taxa(). This function further allows to simulate under epidemiological models with an exposed class. The function sim.genespeciestree() simulates coalescent gene trees within birth-death species trees and sim.genetree() simulates coalescent gene trees.	2023-06-16

r-dunn.test	Computes Dunn's test (1964) for stochastic dominance and reports the results among multiple pairwise comparisons after a Kruskal-Wallis test for stochastic dominance among k groups (Kruskal and Wallis 1952). The interpretation of stochastic dominance requires an assumption that the CDF of one group does not cross the CDF of the other. 'dunn.test' makes k(k-1)/2 multiple pairwise comparisons based on Dunn's z-test-statistic approximations to the actual rank statistics. The null hypothesis for each pairwise comparison is that the probability of observing a randomly selected value from the first group that is larger than a randomly selected value from the second group equals one half; this null hypothesis corresponds to that of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank-sum test. Like the rank-sum test if the data can be assumed to be continuous and the distributions are assumed identical except for a difference in location Dunn's test may be understood as a test for median difference. 'dunn.test' accounts for tied ranks.	2023-06-16

r-fda	These functions were developed to support functional data analysis as described in Ramsay J. O. and Silverman B. W. (2005) Functional Data Analysis. New York: Springer.  They were ported from earlier versions in Matlab and S-PLUS.  An introduction appears in Ramsay J. O. Hooker Giles and Graves Spencer (2009) Functional Data Analysis with R and Matlab (Springer). The package includes data sets and script files working many examples including all but one of the 76 figures in this latter book.  Matlab versions of the code and sample analyses are no longer distributed through CRAN as they were when the book was published.  For those ftp from http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/FDAfuns/ There you find a set of .zip files containing the functions and sample analyses as well as two .txt files giving instructions for installation and some additional information. The changes from Version 2.4.1 are fixes of bugs in density.fd and removal of functions create.polynomial.basis polynompen and  polynomial. These were deleted because the monomial basis does the same thing and because there were errors in the code.	2023-06-16
